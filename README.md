# WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?
> **Machine learning is process in which we allows machine to learn patterns from data and make decision/prediction accordingly.**

# TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING:
1. SUPERVISED
2. UNSUPERVISED/CLUSTERING
3. SEMISUPERVISED
4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

## SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING:
> **Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input data point is paired with a corresponding output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs, allowing it to make predictions or decisions when given new, unseen data.**

## SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

## UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING:
> **Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning there are no explicit output labels provided. The goal is for the model to discover patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without guidance, allowing it to uncover hidden insights, group similar data points together, or reduce the dimensionality of the data.**
